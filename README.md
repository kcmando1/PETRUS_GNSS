# PETRUS_GNSS

This is the progress of the GNSS course where we are developing apps for satellite tracking and positioning 

In the best of cases i'm a mediocre programmer, don't rely on this code for anything important, it is served as it is and without any type of warranty or acceptance of liability if used wrong, each user is responsible for their own actions. 

If you find some typo or a best way to implement a change don't hesitate to open an issue or a request.

Have a good day^^
